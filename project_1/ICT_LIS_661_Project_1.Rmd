# Welcome to R Markdown!

This is an R Markdown document (abbreviated as `.Rmd`). We've already done some exploration of R Markdown, but it's worth going back over some of the basics here. Markdown is a simple markup language (notice the pun?) that is popular in many ICT communities, including data scientists. A markup language is a way of using code to format text.

For example, in Markdown, putting a single asterisk on either side of some text makes it *italics*, putting two asterisks on either side of some text makes it **bold**. You can also use Markdown to format text in other ways, like adding a hyperlink to this [helpful cheatsheet on R Markdown](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rmarkdown-cheatsheet.pdf). 

When you view a raw Markdown document, as you are presumably doing now in RStudio, you're only seeing the raw code, not the actual formatting. To make that magic happen, the document needs to be *knit* together in a way that interprets the code and produces the formatting. For example, a `.docx` file is essentially a very complex markup document, but Microsoft Word (like other word processors) interprets the code behind the scenes and produces the formatting for you. A better example might be a web browser, which interprets HTML (and other) code and gives you a formatted web page. 

HTML is actually quite relevant here, because Markdown is semi-derivative of HTML. That is, Markdown is designed to be converted to HTML, which is then interpreted in a Web browser to be a nice, neat page. However, R Markdown is meant to go beyond some of that original use. In short, R Markdown is a way for data scientists to share their code **and** write up their research. So, the regular Markdown features help data scientists format their regular writing, and then there are *code chunks* a data scientist can add to display—and run—code in a way that will appear alongside their writing and commentary.

Here's what a code chunk looks like:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

When the `.Rmd` document is knit to HTML, not only does the Markdown stuff get formatted, but all of these code chunks are run, so that the code itself **and** the results will appear in the final document. Pretty nifty!

That said, it's often useful to run the code before you knit the file—you know, to make sure the code works properly before you publish it. In that case, you can hit the green "play" button in the top right of the code chunk, and the code will run and display the results—not in the usual console, but in a mini-console attached to the code itself. Try it out on the code-chunk above. You'll need to run your own code to test it as you work with `.Rmd` documents in this class.

# Welcome to Project 1!

Now that we've been (re)introduced to `.Rmd` files, let's talk about what we're going to do with this one. Generally speaking, an `.Rmd` is a handy way for me to have you both show me your code and tell me about your code, all in the same document. There actually isn't any code involved with this project, but it's worth getting familiar with the `.Rmd` format anyway.

Before moving on, please make a copy of this file and rename it in a way that makes a clear distinction between the original file and the file you'll eventually submit.

> Under the headers below, I'll provide you with certain instructions, all of them formatted as blockquotes, like this paragraph is. On a new line underneath each set of blockquoted instructions, you should write a (non-blockquoted) response to any questions I ask. At the very end of this document, I'll provide instructions for *knitting* and submitting the `.Rmd` to Canvas.

# Project 1, Part 1: Your Dataset [3 points]

> For this project, you will need to identify a dataset with at least 100 observations and 5 variables. A dataset with at least 1,000 observations and 10 variables would be even better—but not necessary. This does not need to be a publicly available dataset, but please ensure that you can use the dataset legally and ethically. Store the data somewhere in your GitHub repository for this class.

> Tell me some about this dataset. Does it have a title? If not, what title would you give it? What reference or citation information (including a public URL, if applicable) can you provide about the dataset? Who created the dataset and when? How did they create it? [2 points]
The dataset I choose is "Social Media Influencers in 2022
Top 1000 social media influencers from Instagram,youtube and tiktok each in 2022 https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ramjasmaurya/top-1000-social-media-channels Ram Jas is the owner of the dataset and it was created in 2022 and they created it by a process called "scraping using scrappy"

> What is your interest in this dataset? In general terms, what would you like to know that could be answered with this data? Make sure that at least one thing you're curious about is *causal* in nature: It's about a cause-effect relationship. [1 point]
Gaining followers and becoming a social media influencer is vital for several reasons. It helps you connect with a specific group of people who share your interests. As an influencer, you can promote products and gain revenue from businesses. This data would help me to understand better what brands are looking for in terms of following and content to perfect my content creation on my pages.

# Project 1, Part 2: Reflect on Data Science [2 points]

> Think back to what we learned about in Module 2 of class. How does your dataset relate to the phenomena of data science and big data? For example, is this the kind of data that was easily collected and readily available 50 years ago? Or is there something "new and shiny" about this data? [2 points]

My dataset on the top 1000 social media influencers from Instagram, YouTube, and TikTok in 2022 showcases the evolution of data science and big data in our digital age. Unlike 50 years ago, today's digital era enables easy access to vast and varied data. This dataset includes follower counts, engagement data, and more, reflecting more modern data. My dataset displays big data's "new and improved" aspects, showing how digital platforms have revolutionized data collection, analysis, and understanding of contemporary trends.

# Project 1, Part 3: Reflect on Data Privacy and Ethics [2 points]

> As we discussed in Module 3, data scientists typically assume that the world works in consistent, predictable ways and that the point of data science is to figure out how the world works so that we can get the outcomes we want. There's nothing inherently wrong with these assumptions—they have served us well over the past couple of centuries, and they continue to do so today. However, it's important to consider their limitations. Think about your dataset and your research questions; are there ways that what you're interested in doesn't quite fit the data science view of the world as consistent and predictable? [1 point]

Data science aims to understand data and make predictions, but when it comes to social media influencers, many unpredictable things happen. People's behavior, cultural trends, and changes in social media platforms can be hard to foresee. This unpredictability makes it tough to have a complete and certain data science approach. However, it also makes studying influencers and social media really interesting and always changing in the world of data science.


> There's a lot of good that can be done with data—and a lot of bad that can be done with data. Think about your dataset and research questions. What kind of good could you do by analyzing those data? Is there any harm that a bad actor could do with those data? Are there ways that even well-meaning data scientists could accidentally do harm with those data? [1 point]

Studying the top 1000 social media influencers in 2022 can help brands work better with them and improve content. But there are risks. If handled wrong, it could invade privacy, spread false info, or even lead to trouble for influencers. Even good-hearted data scientists might accidentally make mistakes. They could accidentally show favoritism or not keep info safe. So, it's important to be careful. We need to handle this info respectfully, ensuring it stays private and secure. Talking openly and following rules can help us study this data in a way that helps influencers and keeps everyone safe from problems.

# Project 1, Part 4: Reflect on Open Data [3 points]

> Tell me about where you got your data from. How easy was it to find data that was of interest to you? What other kind of data did you find while looking for a dataset for this project? Could you have collected this data alone if someone else hadn't done the work first? [1 point]
As a content creator, social media and influencers are of great interest to me. I discovered the dataset on Kaggle, a platform for data sharing and analysis. Finding this specific dataset was relatively easy because I knew precisely what I wanted. I focused only on the top 1000 social media influencers in 2022 and didn't explore other datasets during this project. Collecting this data on my own would have been extremely challenging and time-consuming, considering the amount of information needed and the difficulties of tracking and ranking influencers across multiple platforms. So, I greatly benefited from the work done by others in compiling and sharing this dataset on Kaggle.

> Sharing data is easy, but it's also easy to lose track of important information and context along the way. How much do you feel like you know about your dataset? Do you understand what all the variables mean? Do you know how it was collected?  [2 points]

I know the dataset is about the top 1000 social media influencers in 2022, but I only have a basic understanding of it. To understand it better, I need to dig deeper. Right now, I don't know what all the different things in the dataset mean, and I'm unsure how the researcher gathered all this information. To better handle things, I plan to take a closer look at the dataset files and any explanations the researcher has provided. That way, I can figure out what the different parts of the dataset mean and how they got the data in the first place.


# Submitting Project 1

After you've completed all parts of this assignment to your satisfaction, click on the `Knit` button in the toolbar at the top of this pane. When/if prompted, please indicate that you wish to knit to an HTML file. Knitting to PDF or Word are fancy tricks but take some more setting up, and that's beyond the scope of this class. 

After RStudio has finished knitting the file, it will bring it up in a special RStudio interface. You can use this interface to review the document and make sure that everything appears as you want. Then, however, you should navigate to the same folder where you have stored this `.Rmd` file, and you will find a `.html` file with the same name in that same folder. You can open that file to view this in your browser; more importantly, this is the file that you should submit to Canvas to complete this assignment.

I cannot accept any submission of your work besides the knit `.html` file! If you are having trouble knitting, please get in touch with me instead of submitting the `.Rmd` file and hoping it will work instead. Likewise, please don't attempt to manually convert this `.Rmd` file into an `.html` file—that will not work either.
